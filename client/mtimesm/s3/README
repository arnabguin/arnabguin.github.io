Instructions for client:
=======================

* Create a .js file for new client
* Create a new JSON file to enlist steps in flow. For example, chained multiplication can be performed by providing several steps in the JSON file.

Please check sample client.js and steps.json for more details.

JSON file content documentation can be found on the Amazon AWS web site.
